# BharatInterntasks
In this repository, all the tasks that were provided to me during my internship as a web developer at Bharatintern are included.
Task 1 was to create a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
Task 2 was to create a temperature converter using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
Task 3 was to create a Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, and javascript.


All the icons that I have used in these projects are taken from google icons.
