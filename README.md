# BharatInterntasks
In this repository, all the tasks that were provided to me during my internship as a web developer at Bharatintern are included.
task 1 was to create a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
task 2 was to create a temperature converter using HTML, CSS, and javascript.

All the icons that I have used in these projects are taken from google icons.
